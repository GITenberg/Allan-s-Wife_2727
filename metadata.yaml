description: "Allan's Wife and Other Tales is a collection of Allan Quatermain stories\
  \ by H. Rider Haggard, first published in London by Spencer Blackett in December\
  \ 1889. The title story was new, with its first publication intended for the collection,\
  \ but two unauthorized editions appeared earlier in New York, based on pirated galley\
  \ proofs. The other three stories first appeared in an anthology and periodicals\
  \ in 1885, 1887, and 1886.\nThe significance of the collection was recognized by\
  \ its republication (as Allan's Wife, With Hunter Quartermain's Story, a Tale of\
  \ Three Lions, and Long Odds) by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the twenty-fourth\
  \ volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library series in October,\
  \ 1980.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
